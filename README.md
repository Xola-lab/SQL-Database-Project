## Background and Overview:

FOG Clothing Brand, a local fashion label, had been tracking its sales data manually, without recording vital details like dates. The data, stored in a text file, lacked structure, making it difficult to analyse trends or draw insights. To support the brand’s growth, I volunteered to design and implement a relational database to better manage their sales data and improve decision-making.

This project involves the creation of a comprehensive SQL database for FOG Clothing Brand. The database includes key entities such as customers, products, collections, and sales. By organising this data into structured tables, the project enables efficient storage, retrieval, and management of sales information. The database also supports future analytical capabilities, such as sales trend visualisation and customer behaviour analysis.

## Data Structure:

- **Customers**: Stores customer details like names and locations.

- **Products**: Contains product information including name and price.

- **Collections**: Includes different clothing collections offered by FOG.

- **Sales**: Records sales transactions, linking customers, products, and collections.


This database lays the foundation for enhanced business intelligence, empowering the brand to track performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Executive Summary:

This project focuses on creating a structured and scalable database for FOG Clothing, a growing fashion brand, by organising previously unstructured sales data. The objective was to design a robust SQL database that could store customer, product, collection, and sales information in a way that enables efficient querying and data analysis.

By normalising the data and establishing relationships between the tables, the database provides FOG Clothing with a solid foundation for tracking sales trends, managing inventory, and optimising business decisions. The project not only resolves inconsistencies in the raw data but also opens opportunities for future integration with analytical tools, empowering the brand to leverage its data for strategic growth.

### Skills Employed:

- **SQL Database Design**: Created normalised tables with foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity and optimise database performance.

- **Data Modeling**: Developed a schema to capture essential business elements—customers, products, collections, and sales—enabling meaningful data connections.

- **Data Insertion & Manipulation**: Efficiently inserted sales data, ensuring proper handling of foreign key relationships and cascading updates/deletions.

- **Problem Solving**: Resolved data inconsistencies and handled missing data (e.g., sales with incomplete addresses).

### Impact:

- **Data Organisation**: Transformed fragmented, unstructured sales data into an organised, queryable database, allowing easy access and analysis.

- **Business Efficiency**: By centralising sales and product data, the database supports FOG Clothing’s ability to track sales trends, manage inventory, and make informed decisions.
